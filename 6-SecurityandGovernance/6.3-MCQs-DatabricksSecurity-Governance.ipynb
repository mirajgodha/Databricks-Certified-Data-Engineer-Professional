    "**Flashcard 1**\n",
    "Q: What does RBAC stand for in Databricks and what are its key components?\n",
    "A: Role-Based Access Control. Key components:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Principals (users, groups, service principals)\n",
    "- Securable objects (catalogs, schemas, tables, functions, volumes)\n",
    "- Privileges (SELECT, CREATE, MODIFY, etc.)\n",
    "- Roles or groups that bundle privileges\n",
    "\n",
    "***\n",
    "\n",
    "**Flashcard 2**\n",
    "Q: How does privilege inheritance work in Unity Catalog?\n",
    "A: Privileges granted at higher levels (catalog) cascade down to schemas and tables. More specific grants override general ones. Explicit DENY at any level always takes precedence.\n",
    "\n",
    "***\n",
    "\n",
    "**Flashcard 3**\n",
    "Q: Which SQL command creates a group and which one adds a user to it?\n",
    "A:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Create group: `CREATE GROUP group_name;`\n",
    "- Add user: `ALTER GROUP group_name ADD USER 'user@example.com';`\n",
    "\n",
    "***\n",
    "\n",
    "**Flashcard 4**\n",
    "Q: What’s the difference between an enforced constraint and a metadata-only constraint?\n",
    "A:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Enforced (NOT NULL, CHECK): Validated at write time by Delta Engine; violations block writes.\n",
    "- Metadata-only (PRIMARY KEY, FOREIGN KEY, UNIQUE): Recorded for governance; not enforced at runtime.\n",
    "\n",
    "***\n",
    "\n",
    "**Flashcard 5**\n",
    "Q: How do you define a CHECK constraint on a Delta table?\n",
    "A:\n",
    "\n",
    "```sql\n",
    "ALTER TABLE table_name\n",
    "ADD CONSTRAINT chk_name CHECK (column_name condition);\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "***\n",
    "\n",
    "**Flashcard 6**\n",
    "Q: What happens when you add a NOT NULL or CHECK constraint to a table that already has violating data?\n",
    "A: The `ALTER TABLE` fails; Delta checks existing data and refuses to add the constraint until all rows satisfy it.\n",
    "\n",
    "***\n",
    "\n",
    "**Flashcard 7**\n",
    "Q: How do you capture data lineage automatically in Unity Catalog for a SQL table creation?\n",
    "A: Use `CREATE TABLE ... AS SELECT ...`; Unity Catalog records source and target tables in its lineage graph automatically.\n",
    "\n",
    "***\n",
    "\n",
    "**Flashcard 8**\n",
    "Q: Which system table shows table-level lineage in Databricks?\n",
    "A: `system.access.table_lineage`\n",
    "\n",
    "***\n",
    "\n",
    "**Flashcard 9**\n",
    "Q: What SQL function would you use to view column-level lineage?\n",
    "A: Query `system.access.column_lineage`\n",
    "\n",
    "***\n",
    "\n",
    "**Flashcard 10**\n",
    "Q: What is the purpose of watermarking in Structured Streaming?\n",
    "A: Watermarks define how late data can arrive before being considered “too late.” They bound state size by allowing old state to be cleaned up after the watermark passes.\n",
    "\n",
    "***\n",
    "\n",
    "**Flashcard 11**\n",
    "Q: How do you set a watermark on an event-time column?\n",
    "A:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "df.withWatermark(\"event_time\", \"10 minutes\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "***\n",
    "\n",
    "**Flashcard 12**\n",
    "Q: What does `.dropDuplicates([\"order_id\",\"order_timestamp\"])` do when used with a watermark?\n",
    "A: Deduplicates streaming rows by `order_id` and `order_timestamp` within the watermark window, discarding duplicates and late events beyond the watermark.\n",
    "\n",
    "***\n",
    "\n",
    "**Flashcard 13**\n",
    "Q: What is the difference between encryption at rest and encryption in transit?\n",
    "A:\n",
    "\n",
    "- At rest: Data is encrypted on disk (e.g., EBS, S3, Delta files)\n",
    "- In transit: Data is encrypted over the network (e.g., TLS/SSL for cluster communication, JDBC)\n",
    "\n",
    "***\n",
    "\n",
    "**Flashcard 14**\n",
    "Q: How do you enable encryption at rest for a Databricks AWS cluster’s EBS volumes?\n",
    "A: Set `aws_attributes.ebs_volume_encrypted = true` and provide a KMS key via `ebs_volume_kms_key_id` in the cluster configuration.\n",
    "\n",
    "***\n",
    "\n",
    "**Flashcard 15**\n",
    "Q: How does `foreachBatch` in Structured Streaming differ from `writeStream.table`?\n",
    "A: `foreachBatch` lets you run arbitrary batch logic (e.g., merges, multi-sink writes) on each micro-batch. `writeStream.table` writes to a Delta table directly without custom logic.\n",
    "\n",
    "***\n",
    "\n",
    "**Flashcard 16**\n",
    "Q: What does `trigger(availableNow=True)` do in a streaming query?\n",
    "A: Processes all currently available data once as a micro-batch, then stops the query (backfill mode).\n",
    "\n",
    "***\n",
    "\n",
    "**Flashcard 17**\n",
    "Q: Name two advantages of using UDFs in Databricks.\n",
    "A:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Extend built-in functionality with custom logic\n",
    "- Handle specialized business rules (e.g., encryption, parsing) not covered by native functions\n",
    "\n",
    "***\n",
    "\n",
    "**Flashcard 18**\n",
    "Q: Why is it best practice to use groups rather than individual user grants?\n",
    "A: Groups simplify management and ensure consistency. New users inherit group permissions automatically without individual grant changes.\n",
    "\n",
    "***\n",
    "\n",
    "**Flashcard 19**\n",
    "Q: How can you monitor access to sensitive PII tables?\n",
    "A: Query `system.access.audit` for `SELECT` events on tables tagged as containing PII, filter by `user_identity`, `action_name`, and table name.\n",
    "\n",
    "***\n",
    "\n",
    "**Flashcard 20**\n",
    "Q: What is Zero Trust, and how can it be implemented in Databricks?\n",
    "A: Zero Trust means verify every access request. Implement by combining IP allow lists, MFA checks, role-based privileges, risk-based policies, and network isolation (VPC, private endpoints).\n",
