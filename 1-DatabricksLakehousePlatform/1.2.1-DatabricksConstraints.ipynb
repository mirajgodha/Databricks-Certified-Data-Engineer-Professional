    "## 🧪 Databricks Constraints – Hands-On Mini-Lab\n",
    "\n",
    "This exercise helps students understand enforced and informational constraints in Databricks Delta tables. We'll:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Explore NOT NULL and CHECK (enforced) constraints\n",
    "- Show primary key (PK) and foreign key (FK) informational constraints (not enforced)\n",
    "- Demonstrate what happens when you add a constraint to a table with existing data\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. Create a Delta Table Without Constraints\n",
    "\n",
    "```sql\n",
    "CREATE OR REPLACE TABLE employees (\n",
    "  id INT,\n",
    "  name STRING,\n",
    "  salary INT,\n",
    "  dept STRING\n",
    ");\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. Insert Sample Data, Including Some Problematic Rows\n",
    "\n",
    "```sql\n",
    "INSERT INTO employees VALUES (1, 'Alice', 100000, 'HR');\n",
    "INSERT INTO employees VALUES (2, NULL, 90000, 'IT');    -- NULL name (should trigger NOT NULL constraint)\n",
    "INSERT INTO employees VALUES (3, 'Bob', -5000, 'Sales'); -- Negative salary (should trigger CHECK constraint)\n",
    "INSERT INTO employees VALUES (4, 'Carol', 80000, NULL);\n",
    "INSERT INTO employees VALUES (4, 'Eve', 70000, 'HR');    -- Duplicate id for PK test\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. Add a NOT NULL Constraint\n",
    "\n",
    "Try making the `name` column NOT NULL **after data already exists**:\n",
    "\n",
    "```sql\n",
    "ALTER TABLE employees ALTER COLUMN name SET NOT NULL;\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Question:** What error do you get? What does this tell you about NOT NULL enforcement and existing data?\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4. Add a CHECK Constraint\n",
    "\n",
    "Try adding a constraint that salary >= 0:\n",
    "\n",
    "```sql\n",
    "ALTER TABLE employees ADD CONSTRAINT chk_salary_nonnegative CHECK (salary >= 0);\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Question:** Does this command succeed or fail, and why?\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### 5. Try Adding a NOT NULL or CHECK Constraint That Can Succeed\n",
    "\n",
    "Clean up the data so all names are NOT NULL and salaries are >= 0, then try again:\n",
    "\n",
    "```sql\n",
    "DELETE FROM employees WHERE name IS NULL OR salary < 0;\n",
    "\n",
    "ALTER TABLE employees ALTER COLUMN name SET NOT NULL;\n",
    "ALTER TABLE employees ADD CONSTRAINT chk_salary_nonnegative CHECK (salary >= 0);\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Question:** What happens now? Can you insert new rows breaking the constraint?\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### 6. Test Constraint Enforcement by Inserting Invalid Data\n",
    "\n",
    "Try these:\n",
    "\n",
    "```sql\n",
    "INSERT INTO employees VALUES (5, NULL, 85000, 'Finance');      -- will NOT work (name NULL)\n",
    "INSERT INTO employees VALUES (6, 'Dave', -100, 'IT');          -- will NOT work (salary < 0)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Question:** What error messages do you see?\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### 7. Add Informational PRIMARY KEY and FOREIGN KEY Constraints\n",
    "\n",
    "(Add these after cleaning for earlier constraints.)\n",
    "\n",
    "```sql\n",
    "ALTER TABLE employees ADD CONSTRAINT emp_pk PRIMARY KEY (id);\n",
    "-- Suppose you have another table\n",
    "to_departments(id INT, name STRING);\n",
    "ALTER TABLE employees ADD CONSTRAINT emp_dept_fk FOREIGN KEY (dept) REFERENCES to_departments(name);\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Bonus:** Insert another `id = 1` into employees. Does Databricks stop you? Why or why not?\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### 8. Explore Constraints Metadata\n",
    "\n",
    "Check how Databricks shows constraints:\n",
    "\n",
    "```sql\n",
    "DESCRIBE DETAIL employees;\n",
    "SHOW TBLPROPERTIES employees;\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Question:** Which constraints are marked as \"enforced\"? Which as \"not enforced\"?\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Reflection/Discussion Questions\n",
    "\n",
    "- What happens if the data in a table violates a constraint you try to add?\n",
    "- Are NOT NULL and CHECK enforced for existing and new data?\n",
    "- Are PRIMARY KEY and FOREIGN KEY constraints enforced by Databricks?\n",
    "- Why is documenting intention still valuable even if PK/FK aren't enforced?\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 🗝️ Answer/Instructor Key\n",
    "\n",
    "**Step 3:** Adding `NOT NULL` to `name` fails if existing NULLs are present. Databricks checks all current data before adding the constraint and raises an error if any rows already violate it ().[^2][^3][^7]\n",
    "\n",
    "**Step 4:** Adding a CHECK constraint (salary >= 0) fails if any existing row has a negative salary ().[^3][^7][^2]\n",
    "\n",
    "**Step 5:** If you remove bad data first, you can successfully add `NOT NULL` and `CHECK` constraints. Afterward, Databricks will block any inserts/updates violating these constraints.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Step 6:** Inserting a NULL into `name` or a negative salary after the constraint is added causes the write to fail—the transaction errors out with a clear constraint violation message.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Step 7:** **PRIMARY KEY and FOREIGN KEY constraints are informational only on Databricks** ():[^1][^4][^6][^2]\n",
    "\n",
    "- PK: You can still insert duplicate `id` values. Databricks does NOT stop you from violating this \"constraint.\"\n",
    "- FK: You can still insert `dept` values not present in the referenced table. These constraints are not enforced—they just declare intent for tools/optimizers.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Step 8:** `DESCRIBE DETAIL` and `SHOW TBLPROPERTIES` will show NOT NULL and CHECK constraints as \"enforced.\" PK/FK will appear as \"NOT ENFORCED\" or \"INFORMATIONAL.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Learning:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **NOT NULL** and **CHECK**: Enforced at write time for all data (old and new).\n",
    "- **PK/FK**: Metadata/documentation only, not enforced on data.\n",
    "- **Databricks won’t let you add an enforced constraint if existing data violates it.**\n",
